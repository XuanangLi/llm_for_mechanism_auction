In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between ¥0 and ¥{{private}}, with all values equally likely.
After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between ¥0 and ¥{{private}} in ¥{{increment}} increments.
The highest bidder wins the prize and pays their bid amount. This means that, if you win, we will add to your earnings the value for the prize, and subtract from your earnings your bid. If you don't win, your earnings remain unchanged.
After each auction, we will display all bids and profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
