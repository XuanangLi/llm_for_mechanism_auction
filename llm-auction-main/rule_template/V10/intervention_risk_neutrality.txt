In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between $0 and ${{private}}, with all values equally likely.
After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and ${{private}} in ${{increment}} increments.
The highest bidder wins the prize and pays the second-highest bid. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize and decrease by the second-highest bid. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
You are neutral about risk. This means that you are the type of person that would pay $5 for a coin toss where you got $0.00 on tails and $10.00 on heads. 
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
