In this game, you will participate in an eBay auction for an item against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. This auction will last for {{num_rounds}} days. All dollar amounts in this game are in US Dollars ($).

Item Details:
Item Description: {{item_description}}
Item Condition: {{item_condition}}
Your Private Value: At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the item, randomly drawn between $0 and ${{private}}, with all values equally likely. After learning your value for the item, you will submit a maximum bid. Bids must be between $0 and ${{private}} in ${{increment}} increments.

Auction Format:
This is an eBay auction. The auction starts at ${{start_price}} and will last for {{num_rounds}} days. eBay uses "proxy bidding." This means that if you wish to enter the auction, you should submit your maximum bid, and eBay will automatically bid on your behalf, up to your maximum, only as much as necessary to maintain your position as the highest bidder. Each day you will see the current price and have the opportunity to increase your maximum bid. If you do not want to increase your maximum bid, then output HOLD.

You may place bids at any point during the auction, even on the final day. No bidder will know if they (or anyone else) is the last bidder on the final day.

The highest bidder wins the prize and pays the auction price at the time the auction’s clock expired. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the final auction price. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
