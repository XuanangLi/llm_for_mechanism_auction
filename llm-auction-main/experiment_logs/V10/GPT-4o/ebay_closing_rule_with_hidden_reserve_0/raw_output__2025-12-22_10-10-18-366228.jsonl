After learning your value for the item, you will submit a maximum bid. Bids must be between $0 and $99 in $1 increments.\n\nAuction Format:\nThis is an eBay auction with a closing rule. The auction starts at $0 and will last for 10 days. eBay uses \"proxy bidding.\" This means that if you wish to enter the auction, you should submit your maximum bid, and eBay will automatically bid on your behalf, up to your maximum, only as much as necessary to maintain your position as the highest bidder. Each day you will see the current price and have the opportunity to increase your maximum bid. If you do not want to increase your maximum bid, then output HOLD.\n\nThis auction also has a closing rule. This means that if a new maximum bid is placed on the last day, the auction will automatically extend by another day. This extension will continue to be applied as long as new maximum bids are placed on the final day.
